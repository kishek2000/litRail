# transport.me
The repository for Team 3 in class 9808 of DESN2000, for the project of creating a mobile app that solves problems in the space of public transport!
We've created a mobile app prototype that removes the need for you to have multiple applications just to get from A to B, by instead providing a way for you to do it all in one place.
